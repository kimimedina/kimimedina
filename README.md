My name is Kimi Medina-Castellano and I am a fourth-year Math and Physics student at the University of Kentucky! You can reach me at kimi.medina@uky.edu. Ask me about getting into undergraduate research and I'll tell you all about it! I have experience with research funded/sponsored by the Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, and NASA.
